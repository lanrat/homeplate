# HomePlate Hardware

I mounted my Inkplate 10 in a 8"x10" metal frame with enough depth to fit the Inkplate. I also made a mat custom frame mat cut to the exact size of the Inkplate's display size.

The mat is held to the Inkplate by two tiny bits of Sticky Tack on the Inkplate's PCB.

The inkplate and mat are held in the frame by the frame clips and some scraps of foam to not damage the Inkplate's PCB. See the photo below.

I also added a 2nd [USB-C port](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09KC1SMGD/) on the back of the inkplate for charging since the existing one is no longer accessible due to it being blocked by the frame. I even went the extra mile and connected USB D+ and D- so that I can reprogram the HomePlate over USB as well.
