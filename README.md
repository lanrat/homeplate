## Features

* Display Home Assistant dashboards on a beautiful e-ink display
* Display WiFi QR Codes for guests/friends to connect to home/guest wifi
* Can display messages directly from Home Assistant over MQTT
* Makes full use of the ESP32's cores with [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/)
* Reports sensor data to Home Assistant over MQTT (Temperature, Battery, WiFi, etc..)
* Can change Activity displayed via MQTT Command (HASS dashboard, WiFi QR, Stats, text message, etc..)
* Syncs RTC over NTP
* Touch-pad buttons can start activities and wake from sleep
* 1 month+ battery life!
* Low battery warning displayed and sent over MQTT
* OTA updates over WiFi
* Partial screen updates in grayscale mode.
* Power saving sleep mode.
* Display any PNG image from MQTT Command

## Future Ideas

* Incorporate [WiFi Manager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) for settings

## Setup

### [Hardware](hardware.md)

See [hardware.md](hardware.md)

### Home Assistant Dashboard

Create a Home Assistant Dashboard you want to display. I recommend using the [kiosk-mode](https://github.com/maykar/kiosk-mode), [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) and [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card) plugins to customize and tune the dashboard for your display.

Setup [sibbl](https://github.com/sibbl/)'s [hass-lovelace-kindle-screensaver](https://github.com/sibbl/hass-lovelace-kindle-screensaver) or [my fork hass-screenshot](https://github.com/lanrat/hass-screenshot) to regularly screenshot the desired dashboards for the HomePlate.

### More information in [hass.md](hass.md) and [dashboard.md](dashboard.md)

### Inkplate

Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). Then copy `src/config_example.h` to `src/config.h` and enter your settings.

Build & run with:

```shell
pio run
```

The first flash/installation needs to be done over USB. Future updates can be done over USB or WiFi with:

```shell
pio run -e ota
```

To monitor serial output without re-flashing:

```shell
pio device monitor
```

### Updating

```shell
git pull
pio upgrade
pio pkg update
pio run --target clean
```

### Debugging

If you get the following error while booting your inkplate, run the [Inkplate_Wavefrom_EEPROM_Programming](https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-Arduino-library/tree/master/examples/Inkplate10/Others/Inkplate_Wavefrom_EEPROM_Programming) example to update your Inkplate's waveform.

```text
Waveform load failed! Upload new waveform in EEPROM. Using default waveform.
```

Older Inkplates don't appear to ship with an updated waveform. I found waveform 3 looks the best for mine.
